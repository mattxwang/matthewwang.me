          <p>
            I'm currently at UCLA double-majoring in the arcane arts of computer science and
            math-economics! I'm particularly interested in the intersection between computer science, education, and public economics. Diversity and inclusion are core to everything I do.
          </p>
          <p>
            I (mostly) enjoy working with computers: websites, apps, backends, servers, embedded systems, games, machine
            learning, you name it! I am particularly passionate about open-source software - I spend more time on GitHub
            than Instagram!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm really passionate about education and outreach. I am currently focused on democratizing access to CS education - through Teach LA, BEAM, and community-building at UCLA. Kids are <em>mostly</em> fun to
            work with.

                I help out with <a href="https://qwerhacks.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">QWER Hacks</a>, America's first collegiate LGTBTQIA+ hackathon. In 2021, I led workshops on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mattxwang/qwerhacks-21-workshops">React, Firestore, and the education track</a>. In 2020, I led workshops on <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/mattxwang/qwerhacks-web-dev-workshop">web development (with React + Firebase)</a> and EdTech.

          Prior to UCLA, I grew up and went to high school in Toronto, Canada. I did competitive debating and Model UN, taught computer science and robotics, and dabbled in event planning, journalism, and design.
