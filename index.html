          <p>
            I'm currently at UCLA double-majoring in the arcane arts of computer science and
            math-economics! I'm particularly interested in the intersection between computer science and education. Can we teach people better with computers? Can we design computers to be easier to learn?
          </p>
          <p>
            Diversity, equity, and inclusion are core to everything I do.
          </p>
          <p>
            I (mostly) enjoy working with computers: websites, programming languages, apps, backends, servers, embedded systems, compilers, games, machine learning, cloud computing, you name it! I'm a huge fan of open-source - I'm always on GitHub!
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm really passionate about education and outreach. I am currently focused on democratizing access to CS education - through <a class="link-em acm-link" href="https://uclaacm.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">

            <p>
              I got started in 2018 as a web developer for Teach LA, and promptly fell in love. I'm last served as the president of the club (2020-2021), which let me handle a broad scope of activities:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>

              <li>
                spearheaded <b>learning labs</b>, an internally-developed set of interactive web modules; acted as a PM, lead dev, and supporting dev for different projects
              </li>
              <li>

              </li>
              <li>
                kickstarted work on interactive web modules to teach cybersecurity, networking and machine learning concepts; eventually became <b>learning labs</b>
              </li>
              <li>
                architected and developed React + Redux frontend for online Code IDE

      I think this is pretty cool: basically, you can use CSS styles for console logs. You can check out what this looks like by looking at the Javascript console.

      Here's what the banner text looks like:
