      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        This is a failure resume. It's a list of the things that I feel comprise my biggest personal failures: primarily my work, school, and recruiting, but also a potpourri of other things too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was particularly motivated to make this after conversations with many of my peers at UCLA. Just like Instagram, LinkedIn and GitHub showcase fake personas: someone with infinite successes, and no failures. This is one component of the looming spectre of impostor syndrome. So, I decided to be transparent with my own failures - not necessarily a fun experience, but to me, a necessary one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll also note that these things are failures <i>to me</i>. It's purely subjective, and I recognize that I'm extremely priviliged to have some of these opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many thanks to <a class="link-em" href="https://www.katmh.com/fail" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kat Huang's Failure Resume</a> for the inspiration - I would strongly recommend you read her thoughts on it!
