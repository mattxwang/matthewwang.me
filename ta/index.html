        Glad to hear it! The process depends on what course you'd like to TA for. The following is a bulleted list of
        all the courses that I have (or know that I will teach) at UW, organized by quarter (or in some cases, year);
        please go to the section for the relevant course(s).

      <p class="my-2">
        If you are interested in teaching computer science, I would strongly encourage you to apply to be a TA &mdash;
        even if you don't have much prior experience or feel that you don't have stellar grades. In many cases, those
        perspectives will inform how you support students in similar situations &mdash; of which there are many!
      </p>
      <p class="my-2">
        Many different factors go into TA hiring. While some are in your control (e.g. what you put in your
        application), some are not (e.g. enrollment in that class, in that quarter). If you aren't hired in a specific
        application cycle, that does not mean that you cannot (or will not) be a successful TA. If you are still
        interested, I would highly encourage you to continue applying in subsequent quarters.

        The CSE 12X (and 14X) courses have their own application process, which is <strong>not</strong> managed by
        individual 12X instructors. For more information (including what the process is and how to apply), please see

      <p class="my-2">
        Generally, hiring for the <a class="link"
          href="https://www.engr.washington.edu/admission/pathways-inclusive-excellence">PIE program</a> support classes
        (for 190W/X/Y: <a class="link" href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/students/ugrad/directadmission/startup">Allen
          Scholars</a>; for 190Z: <a class="link" href="https://www.engr.washington.edu/stars">STARS</a>) is very
        instructor-dependent, differs from the general CSE TA application, and can vary significantly year-on-year.
      </p>
      <p class="my-2">
        In prior years, hiring for the following academic year begins in spring quarter and continues through the
        summer. However, I do not currently have any information to share about the 2025-2026 academic year
        hiring cycle. If you have questions, feel free to send me an email (at <a class="link"
          href="mailto:mxw@cs.washington.edu">mxw@cs.washington.edu</a>).
      </p>
      <p class="my-2">
        Note: being a TA for CSE 190W/X/Y/Z is a significantly different experience than being a TA for most other
        CSE classes at UW. Among other things, it requires a strong knowledge of at least one of the aforementioned PIE
        programs. If you are not yet familiar with those programs, I would highly encourage that you first learn more
        about them.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold">cse 391 (23au, 24wi, 24su)</h2>
      <p class="my-2">
        Please fill out the <a class="link" href="https://ta.cs.washington.edu/apply/">general CSE TA application</a>
        and include the string "CSE 391" in your personal statement. In addition, please (briefly) explain why you would
        like to be a TA for CSE 391. There are no other components to the application process.
      </p>
      <p class="my-2">
        Note: being a TA for CSE 391 is a much lighter workload than being a TA for most other CSE classes at UW.
        This can be a good thing (it's less work, and a gentle introduction to teaching) but also may not be what you're
        expecting (there are no quiz sections, there is almost no grading, and in general, there are less opportunities
        to grow and develop as a TA). In some quarters, 391 may not have a TA (depending on enrollment).
