Hey there! This is the GitHub repository for my website, which you can find at [matthewwang.me](https://matthewwang.me)! I've written almost all of the code myself, barring Font Awesome. One of the new features that I've added is a dark mode - try it out!

To be honest, I'm never super happy with how the website works, so you might see everything here change soon. Until then, feel free to shoot me any critiques or spelling errors you find at [matt@matthewwang.me](mailto:matt@matthewwang.me).

Note: unlike the vast majority of my code, this website is **not licensed** - [that means normal copyright rules still apply](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository#choosing-the-right-license). That being said, if you have any questions about the site, more than willing to talk about it - send me an email!
