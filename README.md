# [matthewwang.me](https://matthewwang.me) (and also, [mattx.wang](https://mattx.wang))

Hey there! This is the GitHub repo for my personal (but also now, somewhat academic/professional) website. It mostly only serves the index page, + some auxiliary pages (right now, my will).

To be honest, I'm never super happy with how the website works, so you might see everything here change soon. Until then, feel free to shoot me any critiques or spelling errors you find at [matt@matthewwang.me](mailto:matt@matthewwang.me) (or, open an issue).

Note: unlike the vast majority of my code, this website is **not licensed** - [that means normal copyright rules still apply](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository#choosing-the-right-license). That being said, if you have any questions about the site, more than willing to talk about it - send me an email!
