      matt's will
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <h2 class="text-2xl my-2">what is this?</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      this originally started as a half-joke, but is now intended to be serious. If a standard will does not exist at the time of my death, this document should be used instead.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">(admittedly, I have not consulted a lawyer about this. I probably should.)</p>
    <p class="my-2">
      anyways, here's the play:
    </p>
    <ol class="list-decimal my-2 pl-4">
      <li>
        my executor is Allison Chen. <br>(if she is not available, pick the next available person that appears in this list, in order; any person may decline and pass on the responsibility to the next person)
      </li>
      <li>
        please distribute all monetary assets equally amongst three people: my friends Arjun Subramonian, Karen Yi, and Zian Chen. I place no restrictions on how they may use it.
      </li>
      <li>
        if possible, please grant Leo Krashanoff control of all open-source projects I maintain. (see: <a class="link" href="https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-deceased-user-policy">GitHub Deceased User Policy</a>; if Leo is unavailable, please leave this decision up to the executor)
      </li>
      <li>
        for the rest of my material assets, please form a committee consisting of my friends Annie Zhao, Rohit Nema, and Sharvani Jha; they will decide the assets' outcomes via consensus.
      </li>
      <li>
        I request one last feedback session with as many people as possible, organized by my executor. They are free to interpret this however they wish.
      </li>
      <li>
        (I believe that this is general enough to cover all types of assets I own as of writing. However, in the event of any "loose ends", I would prefer that they are handled directly by my executor. In other words, my residuary clause entrusts all remaining assets to my executor.)
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="my-2">
      I anticipate that tracking people down might be challenging. To disambiguate: in this current iteration of the will, all named people are UCLA alumni who overlapped with my time there; almost all are Computer Science alumni. The network should be a connected (and almost complete) graph.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      In the extremely unlikely case that all named persons are unavailable, I simply request that all possible assets are either donated to a non-profit (of whoever is executing my will!), while the rest is safely disposed of.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      In no circumstance should my parents or any familial (i.e. non-spousal) relatives be contacted or be a beneficiary.
    </p>
