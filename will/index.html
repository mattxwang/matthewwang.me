      <h2>what is this?</h2>
      <p>
        this is mostly a joke, but not entirely - I do have some health problems. In lieu of a standard will (that's kinda sad), I'll haphazardly write something down and hope that a lawyer agrees.
      </p>
      <p>
        anyways, here's the play:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          my executor is Allison Chen. In the event that she is not available, my backups (in order) are Juan Banchs, Geoffrey Jiang, and Liangchi Zhou.
        </li>
        <li>
          please donate all monetary assets equally amongst three people: my friends Annie Zhao, Karen Yi, and Zian Chen. I place no restrictions on how they may use it.
        </li>
        <li>
          for the rest; please form a committee consisting of my friends Arjun Subramonian, Britney Ngaw, John Mace, Kenneth Cui, Malcolm Risk, Rohit Nema, and Sharvani Jha. They will decide where each item will go (via consensus); if they are unable to reach a consensus vote, please give final say to Youngbo Shim.
        </li>
        <li>
          I request one last feedback session with as many people as possible, organized by my executor. They are free to interpret this however they wish.
        </li>
        <li>
          (implicitly, there should be no residuary clause - please leave any issues up to the executor)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I anticipate that this is relatively clear, other than the ability to track people down. In the event that my executor is Allison or Juan - you will want to reach out to someone I knew in high school (i.e. names you're unfamiliar with) to help out. Vice-versa if my executor is Geoffrey or Liangchi. No person here knows nobody else listed - there should be a relatively connected graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        In no circumstance should my parents or any relatives be contacted or be a beneficiary.
      </p>

        (IANAL, but: I am Matthew Wang, of sound mind, and not under any duress. please use this in lieu of a real will!)

      I think this is pretty cool: basically, you can use CSS styles for console logs. You can check out what this looks like by looking at the Javascript console.

      Here's what the banner text looks like:

         __   __  _______  _______  _______
        |  |_|  ||   _   ||       ||       |

        | ||_|| ||   _   |  |   |    |   |
        |_|   |_||__| |__|  |___|    |___|

      While this isn't my favourite font or anything, it has no backslashes: those often cause problems in javascript.
