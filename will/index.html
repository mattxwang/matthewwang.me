    <h2 class="text-2xl my-2">what is this?</h2>
    <p class="my-2">
      this is mostly a joke, but not entirely - I do have some health problems. In lieu of a standard will, this document should be used.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      anyways, here's the play:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc my-2 pl-4">
      <li>
        my executor is Allison Chen. <br>(if she is not available, pick the next available person that appears in this list)
      </li>
      <li>
        please donate all monetary assets equally amongst three people: my friends Annie Zhao, Karen Yi, and Zian Chen. I place no restrictions on how they may use it.
      </li>
      <li>
        if possible, please grant Leo Krashanoff control of all open-source projects I maintain.
      </li>
      <li>
        for the rest of my material assets, please form a committee consisting of my friends Arjun Subramonian, Rohit Nema, and Sharvani Jha; they will decide the assets' outcomes via consensus.
      </li>
      <li>
        I request one last feedback session with as many people as possible, organized by my executor. They are free to interpret this however they wish.
      </li>
      <li>
        (implicitly, there should be no residuary clause - please leave any issues up to the executor)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="my-2">
      I anticipate that tracking people down might be challenging. In this current iteration of the will, all named people are UCLA alumni. The network should be a completed graph.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      In no circumstance should my parents or any relatives be contacted or be a beneficiary.
    </p>
    <hr class="my-4">
    <p class="my-2">
      (IANAL, but: I am Matthew Wang, of sound mind, and not under any duress. please use this in lieu of a real will!)
